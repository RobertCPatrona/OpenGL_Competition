# OpenGL_Competition
An OpenGL project for CG Competition.

## Instructions
Simple build and run using qt creator.

## Scenes
**Scene 1**: A recreation of interstellar docking scene

**Scene 2**: Hollow-Face illusion with cookies (model generated using a free photogrammtery software) [3DF Zephyr](https://www.3dflow.net/3df-zephyr-pro-3d-models-from-photos/)

**Scene 3**: Hollow-Face illusion with a face (model generated using a free photogrammtery software) [3DF Zephyr](https://www.3dflow.net/3df-zephyr-pro-3d-models-from-photos/)

### Notes on Scene 2 and 3 (Cookies and face)
Experimenting with photogrammetry models with face culling disabled inspired us to create scenes that demonstrated the [Hollow-Face illusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaofyuCXZ_0).

The illusion shows the meshes to be rotating both clockwise and anti-clockwise.
